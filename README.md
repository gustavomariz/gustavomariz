ðŸ‘‹ Hey! My name is Gustavo Mariz and I am a brazilian Junior Developer and a Computer Science student at UFRJ. I'm very passionate about tech and music and, in a near future, 
   I'll try to get both of them together in a project. I'm currently learning JavaScript and I already have experience with HTML5 CSS and Python.
   As of today, I would love to colaborate in any project! Specifically if it involves music and tech! Be free to give me any feedback in any of my projects, I would love to see what you think about them!
